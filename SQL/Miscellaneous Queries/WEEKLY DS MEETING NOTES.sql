-- WEEKLY DS MEETING NOTES

/* FOR 8/6/21 MEETING

    SMIHD-22181 SMI version of Open Purchase Orders report needed for accounting
        - hour long phone call with Vicki on Tuesday

    Meeting with - Andrew, Al, Brant, Arlene, Connie regarding anyalysis of guaranteed orders not arriving on time
        - majority of missed ordes are on the shipper side.  FED-EX in particular is apparently have majore issues
        - focus of meeting was analyzing what's causing orders shipping too late on our side
        - it sounds like a big chunk of orders are getting placed on the wrong trailers in the warehouse 
            (Brant said like 10% of orders that should have gone on KC trailer were getting put on Omaha trailer for the example set he looked at)
        - they're researching other mispull issues
            I told them were they could find mispull info at the orderline level so they can figure out what % of late ships are caused by mispulls
        - reviewing the entire timing on orders to see if there are other big delays in the VA/hold/release/print process

    SMIHD-22190 - LB Data extract logic changes
        - Why the hell did LB wait so long to tell us about the discrepancies!?!
                - Logic changes impacted 5 out of the 7 monthly extract files we deliver will deliver
        - making changes ASAP will deliver extracts by EOD Friday

    Worked with RJ in People Opps and Rose in IT. They processed the first big Monthly file, made some tweaks to it a few times and Rose processed all of it.
        - she found a few things PO missed (supervisor changes on about 6 employees) but overall it went fairly smoothly.
        - RJ agreed to send the file weekly so the data will be synced much more frequently between the two systems. 
            - Also, the batch sizes will be much smaller and quicker for the IT people to update in SOP.
